## Principle

Name based on the context

Be the most specific

Be the most concise (remove redundant clarifier)

Try not to use only 1 character name

Function names start with a verb

Never use type as part of the name

Same thing should have the same name everywhere

Never abbreviate

Rename as necessary

## Practice

Avoid using pandas

pandas DataFrame => df

pandas Series => sr

pandas Index => ix\_

Plural of x => x\_

Boolen flag starts with is\_

File name or directory name => name

Number array 2D => matrix

Number array 1D => vector

Priority: simplest way > numpy > other

Avoid merging a base dictionary and a new one

Plotly layout keyword arguments must be named hierarchically

Never use > or >=

Use suffix to remember whatever is done to a variable

Don't reuse variable name in the same scope

Stop decorating a name as soon as it is clear

Be explicit

Variable name can capture algorithm

matrix name should end with matrix

vector name should end with vector

table name should end with table

array\_0, array\_2

array_nd

dictionary => key_to_value

number_array

matrix_is_good

For 2D array, work on only the axis 0

Make the default argument type match the wanted type of the variable

Check for True instead of not False

job_n

data_max_depth

thing_fraction

thing_height

thing_size

As far as you can take it, use 0, 1 system before x, y system

open file as io

1D = 1d

2D = 2d

ND = nd

Directory ends with /

Don't repeat markdown title; title is the file name and start the block with 2nd level ##

You can remove a json key that you want to keep as a reminder by prefixing it with \_

Considering paht over file_path or directory_path (infer the type of the path)
